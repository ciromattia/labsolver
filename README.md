**Labyrinth Solver** is a 2001 Scheme project developed in my first academic IT course.

## Disclaimer
This program is freeware as it is.  
None of its parts can be modified without the permission of the authors.  

## REQUIREMENTS
`labsolver.ss` has been developed with **PLT DrScheme v.103** with functional constructs.  
**DrScheme** has been configured with:
- **Language:** Advanced Student (the program will not run at any below level)
- **Teachpacks:**
  - gui.ss
  - draw.ss
  - graphing.ss

Running with **MIT Scheme** or other Scheme implementations is casual and not supported.  
Today (2013) **DrScheme** has been replaced by [DrRacket](http://racket-lang.org/) but at the moment this older
script reports a bunch of errors. If you happen to make it work, please report.
